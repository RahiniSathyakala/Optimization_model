# 🏥 Hospital Resource Optimizer

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **Linear Programming Optimization Model** for efficient hospital resource management.  
It helps allocate **nurses** and **beds** across departments such as **ER, ICU, and General Ward** based on available resources and patient demand.  

The goal is to **maximize hospital efficiency** and **minimize unmet demand**, ensuring every department gets the resources it needs — even during shortages.  

---

## ⚙️ Features

* ✅ Optimal allocation of **nurses** and **beds** across departments  
* ✅ Uses **Linear Programming (PuLP)** for mathematical optimization  
* ✅ Displays results with **clear tabular reports**  
* ✅ Calculates **unmet demand** for each department  
* ✅ Easy to customize and run — no web dependencies required  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Editor**: Visual Studio Code  
* **Language**: Python 3.11  
* **Libraries**: Pandas, PuLP  

---

## 🚀 Applications

This optimization model can be applied to:  

* 🏥 Hospital staff and bed management  
* 💉 Emergency resource reallocation planning  
* 🧠 Healthcare operations research  
* 📈 Capacity optimization for healthcare facilities
